## Anyone can do Server Swift

Server code is not reserved for the intellectual elite. Swift’s low memory footprint, safety, compile-time speed, and expressiveness that make it great for native apps also make it great for server uses.

## How do we get started with server Swift?

You don’t need to start huge! Get accustomed to server workflow and doing networking with this proof of concept project.

Clone the repo. Change the Developer Team. Build and Run.

Find a folder to serve files from, then start seeing how server interactions work.

## Where to go from here?

1. I recommend reading through popular Swift server libraries. Two popular ones are [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) and [Hummingbird](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird).
2. Find some tutorials. My favorites are the great videos by [NSScreencast](https://nsscreencast.com/episodes) or the [Server-Side Swift with Vapor](https://www.kodeco.com/21451628-server-side-swift-with-vapor) on Kodeco.
3. Join some communities for chat and support. Look for the `#server` channel in your work or iOS devs Slack. Join in with the [Hummingbird](https://discord.com/invite/7ME3nZ7mP2) and [Vapor](https://discord.gg/vapor) Discords.
4. Share your stories! I’d love to congratulate your successes or comiserate in your problems [on socials](https://mastodon.social/@pixelscience).
